-- Key Insights
This analysis provides an interesting look into how parental education may influence their children's academic performance and mental well-being. While it's commonly assumed that higher parental education correlates with better outcomes, the data tells a different story:

1. Exam Scores
Children whose parents hold a Master’s degree appear more frequently in the Low Score group and less frequently in the High Score group, compared to children whose parents only completed High School or Bachelor’s degree.

2. Mental Health
Mental health ratings were lower among students whose parents had a Master’s degree. This pattern was observed for both male and female students.
